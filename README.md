# CustomDelegates

This is intended for learning purposes, through a console farm game ,,FarmingGoneWild,, to indicate how:

1. delegates and events-
2. dependency injection containers-
3. extensions for functional programming workflows-
4. coming soon..

-work.

There are well established .NET libraries that abstracts this behavior away from the developer like .NET framework,
MediatR, MartenDB, Linq, etc. We see it as fundamental to understand how the underlying mechanism can look like, and
therefore we welcome you to play,pause, and debug FarmingGoneWild.
