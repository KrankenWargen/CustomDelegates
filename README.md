# CustomDelegates

This is intended for demonstrating, through a console farm game ,,FarmingGoneWild,, how:

1. delegates and events-
2. dependency injection containers-
3. extensions for functional programming workflows-
4. attributes for handling the control flow
5. no error throw but return results as FP suggests
6. nosql, or better, a fresh database choice
7. CI/CD integration with webhooks for local deployment in docker or k8s
8. coming soon..

-work.

There are well established .NET libraries that abstracts this behavior away from the developer like .NET framework,
MediatR, MartenDB, Linq, etc. We see it as fundamental to understand how the underlying mechanism can look like, and
therefore we welcome you to play,pause, and debug FarmingGoneWild.
